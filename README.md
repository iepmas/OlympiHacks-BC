## Inspiration
Centralized database centers are expensive, potential targets for hackers, and have full access to everything uploaded to their servers. They abuse their control over user data by selling information to advertisors and if your data is lost or corrupted, they're not liable. By introducing a decentralized data storage solution addresses all of these problems, allowing for smaller companies to trust that their data remains confidential and without such high overhead expenses. 

## What it does?
Dolphin Chains HR Solutions is an HR platform available for companies of all sizes. It allows HR staff to leverage the security and inexpensive nature of blockchain-based storage systems to protect sensitive documents such as payroll information, tax documents, work performance reports, and more.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we managed to accomplish after working tightly with co-founders of Jackal Protocol Patrick, Marston and Aaron.

## What we learned?
